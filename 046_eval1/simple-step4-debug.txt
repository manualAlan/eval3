|Solution 0
+------------------------------------------------------------
| Target launch at (200.00, 0.00)
| Angle 0.00 degrees and takes 10.00 hours
| Arrival time would be 10.00
| At arrival, distance from ship (200.00,0.00) to planet (199.24,17.43) is 17.45
| Will arrive at time 10.00 but need to wait until 720.00
