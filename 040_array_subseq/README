This is another assignment where we are trying out Sense's AI

Once you have written your code, you can use

sense-send

to send it to Sense.  You can do this before you have passed the
assignment (as sometimes they can give some feedback that can help you
figure out what is wrong if you are failing test cases), and/or
after you have passed the assignment (as they can also give you
feedback on code quality that our test cases cannot).

We encourage you to send it at least once after you have
passed to get feedback on code quality.

As always, please remember this is experimental, and don't
be too upset if the AI gives incorrect feedback.

If you edit your code on their site, you can do

sense-get

to download the updates to the MLP.

We hope it works well, and would love to hear
feedback from you on it!

In this assignment you are going to implement maxSeq.

 1. Create a file called maxSeq.c and write the function:
 
      size_t  maxSeq(int * array, size_t n);
      
    which returns the length of the maximum increasing contiguous
    subsequence in the array. The parameter n specifies the length of the
    array. For example, if the array passed in were
   
      {1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 9}
  
    this function would return 4 because the longest sequence of (strictly)
    increasing numbers in that array is 1, 3, 5, 7 which has length 4. Note
    that 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 is an increasing subsequence, but is not contiguous
    (finding discontiguous ones efficiently takes techniques we haven't
    learned yet). 

 2. Compile and test your code using the test-subseq.c you wrote
    previously. (As before, compile the .c files separately, and link them
    together).

 3. Submit your code for maxSeq.c
     
Hint: Can you abstract a complex step out into a simple function?
