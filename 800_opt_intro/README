Assignments numbered 8xx (800, 801, etc) are OPTIONAL.
***********************************************
*  These 8xx DO NOT affect your grade at all. *
***********************************************

These 8xx assignments are here because some of you have
asked for the assignments that existed in 751.

If you don't want to do these, you can just close this
and ignore this assignment. 

If you want to do any of these 8xx assignments, we
want you to understand the following:
   1. These are not part of your grade.
   2. These are less polished than the 551 assignments.
      751 was offered once, and then the pandemic hit,
      then various other things happened.  We haven't
      had the bandwidth to teach it since then.
      This is the *first* year we are trying
      putting these assignments out as optional.
   3. Help on these will be lower priority than
      help on the main assignment stream.  If
      you need help on an 8xx assignment,
      please let other students who need
      help on regular assignments go ahead of you.
   4. The TAs probably can't help you.  You probably
      need help from Drew.
   5. If you post on Ed Discussions, please make
      clear in your subject line that its an 8xx
      assignment to avoid confusing/scaring students
      who do not want to do them.

If you do want to do these, then "grade" this
assignment (there is nothing to submit---the grader
will just pass you and you'll get the 8xx assignments
released at appropriate times).
