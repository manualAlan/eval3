Perform the following conversions. Use 8-bits for all numbers.

1. Convert the decimal number 42 to binary
2. Convert the decimal number 42 to hexadecimal
3. Convert the unsigned hexadecimal number 0xC4 to decimal
   (hint: convert hex -> binary -> decimal).
4. Convert 'z' to its decimal representation
   (hint: there is a man page for character representations.
    Either run "man ascii" from the shell, or M-x man [enter] ascii
    in emacs)
5. Convert 0x54 to the character it corresponds to
   (also use man ascii for this!)
