Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that story-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1 story-step2 story-step3 story-step4  story-step1.o story-step2.o story-step3.o story-step4.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step1.c
gcc -o story-step1 story-step1.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step1 exists (good)
Checking with provided test case story.txt
Your file matched the expected output
Now running YOUR tests for step 1

1.1: Current test is story-step1 story2.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

1.2: Current test is story-step1 story12.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

1.3: Current test is story-step1 story13.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

Step 2
Checking that story-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1 story-step2 story-step3 story-step4  story-step1.o story-step2.o story-step3.o story-step4.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step2.c
gcc -o story-step2 story-step2.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step2.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step2 exists (good)
Now running YOUR tests for step 2

2.1: Current test is story-step2 words8.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

Step 3
Checking that story-step3 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1 story-step2 story-step3 story-step4  story-step1.o story-step2.o story-step3.o story-step4.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step3.c
gcc -o story-step3 story-step3.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step3.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step3 exists (good)
Now running YOUR tests for step 3

3.1: Current test is story-step3 words12.txt story5.txt
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean

3.2: Current test is story-step3 words7.txt story1.txt
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean

3.3: Current test is story-step3 words5.txt story4.txt
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean

3.4: Current test is story-step3 words9.txt story9.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

Step 4
Checking that story-step4 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1 story-step2 story-step3 story-step4  story-step1.o story-step2.o story-step3.o story-step4.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step4.c
gcc -o story-step4 story-step4.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step4.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step4 exists (good)
Now running YOUR tests for step 4

4.1: Current test is story-step4 -n words10.txt story10.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

4.2: Current test is story-step4 -n words3.txt story11.txt

4.8: Current test is story-step4 -n words7.txt story7.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

You have passed the test cases YOU provided
If your tests are good, this is great. 
If your tests are insufficient, you should do much more testing
