Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that story-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1 story-step2  story-step1.o story-step2.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step1.c
gcc -o story-step1 story-step1.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step1 exists (good)
Checking with provided test case story.txt
Your file matched the expected output
Now running YOUR tests for step 1

1.1: Current test is story-step1 story.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

1.2: Current test is story-step1 story1.txt
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean

1.3: Current test is story-step1 story2.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

1.4: Current test is story-step1 story3.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

1.5: Current test is story-step1 story4.txt
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean

1.6: Current test is story-step1 story5.txt
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean

Step 2
Checking that story-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1 story-step2  story-step1.o story-step2.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step2.c
gcc -o story-step2 story-step2.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step2.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step2 exists (good)
Now running YOUR tests for step 2

2.1: Current test is story-step2 words.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

2.2: Current test is story-step2 words1.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

2.3: Current test is story-step2 words2.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

2.4: Current test is story-step2 words3.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

2.5: Current test is story-step2 words4.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

2.6: Current test is story-step2 words.txt w
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean

2.7: Current test is story-step2 words5.txt
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean

Step 3
Checking that story-step3 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1 story-step2  story-step1.o story-step2.o rand_story.o
The code did not compile!
