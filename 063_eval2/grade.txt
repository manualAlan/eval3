Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that story-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1 story-step2 story-step3 story-step4  story-step1.o story-step2.o story-step3.o story-step4.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step1.c
gcc -o story-step1 story-step1.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step1 exists (good)
Checking with provided test case story.txt
Line_1_did_not_match
Line_2_did_not_match
Your file did not match the expected output
Now running YOUR tests for step 1

1.1: Current test is story-step1 story.txt

You considered this a failure case:
timeout: the monitored command dumped core
But we did not.

4.5: Current test is story-step4 -n words10.txt story10.txt
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
Here is the diff (yours on left, ours on right):

A ¡							      |	A smart owl chased after a lazy dog in the forest.
¸W a×~U chased after a Ñ×~U ×~U in the forest.		      |	But the silent rabbit was too fast to catch.

Your file did not match the expected output


4.6: Current test is story-step4 words6.txt story6.txt
-----------------------------
We considered this a failure case.
But you did not (exit status was EXIT_SUCCESS).

4.7: Current test is story-step4 words7.txt story7.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

4.8: Current test is story-step4 -n story8.txt words8.txt
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean

You have NOT passed your test cases!
You should go and figure out/understand where thing went wrong
And fix the problem(s) before the deadline
