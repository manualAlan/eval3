Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that story-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1 story-step2 story-step3 story-step4  story-step1.o story-step2.o story-step3.o story-step4.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step1.c
gcc -o story-step1 story-step1.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step1 exists (good)
Checking with provided test case story.txt
Your file matched the expected output
Now running YOUR tests for step 1

1.1: Current test is story-step1 story.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean

1.2: Current test is story-step1 story1.txt
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean

1.3: Current test is story-step1 story2.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean
