pdouble is now 3*x^5 + 4.5*x^4
or on complex(3,0)*x^5 + (4.5,0)*x^4
p1: 4*x^4 + 2*x^3 + -7*x^2 + -9*x^0
First zero: -1.82691
Second zero: 1.44849
Failed to converge. Last x was 0
Failed to converge. Last x was -27.3221
But will converge to -1.82691 with more steps
pc is (2,1.5)*x^1 + (-2.5,1)*x^0
zero of pc is (0.56,-0.92)
