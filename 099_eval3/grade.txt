Running your test cases
-------------------------
 This test case will run 
 ships-step1 
 With arguments 
 inputs/ships0.txt 
-------------------------
I need to compile your code for ships-step1 (make ships-step1)

Compiling ships-step1
g++ -c -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -pedantic --std=gnu++03 ship.cpp
g++ -c -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -pedantic --std=gnu++03 utilfunc.cpp
g++ -o ships-step1 -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -pedantic --std=gnu++03 step1.cpp ship.o utilfunc.o
rm ship.o utilfunc.o
