--------------------------------
Code quality was graded by: Xianjing Huang
Your TA graded this based on use of C++03
Please ask them if you have any questions:
------------------------------------------
 * Classes are nouns: Always (>90%)
 * Methods are verbs: Always (>90%)
 * Good Use of Has-A: Always (>90%)
 * Good Use of IS-A: Always (>90%)
 * Uses references (avoids needless copies): Always (>90%)
 * Follows Rule of 3: Often (70-90%)
 * Good use of public/private: Always (>90%)
 * const correct: Always (>90%)
 * Good use of STL (vector, set, map): Always (>90%)
 * Avoids Duplicating Code Between Container and Tanker: Yes
 * Uses subtype polymorphism + dynamic dispatch (as opposed to if-else on type of ship): Yes
 * Step 4: Find fitting ship efficiently: O(N)
 * Find method is generic: Yes
Your TA wrote the following comments:
Great job! Your object-oriented approach and proper use of STL containers demonstrate a strong understanding of C++ programming. Your functions are clearly named, and your comments sufficiently explain the logic. Consider improving resource management by following the Rule of 3. Also, you can better leverage AVL properties for efficiency. Keep up the excellent work!

For quality, you earned 28.5 / 32 points
