For this assignment, you are going to write an *English* (not code) algorithm
to generate a sequence of numbers, given a parameter N.  Note that this problem
is AoP Ch 1 Practice Excercise 4 (in case e.g., you would prefer to see
the table more nicely formatted)

In particular, your algorithm should generate these
sequences (but should also work for higher values of N).

N |   Output
--+----------------------------------------
0 |   0  2
1 |   3  5  7  9
2 |   6  8 10 12 14 16
3 |   9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23
4 |  12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30
5 |  15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37

Write your algorithm into a file called "answer.txt".

Once you have written your algorithm into answer.txt run
the command

sense-send

This will send your algorithm to Sense which will give
you feedback using the AI model they built for this problem.
The command should print out a link that you can paste into your browser
to view the feedback.

Please remember that this is highly experimental (this is
their first time trying to do this for natural language
algorithms like this), and don't freak out if there are problems.

If you want to update your algorithm based on the feedback you receive,
you can do one of two things:
  1.  Edit answers.txt on the MLP, then run sense-send again to
      send it to them again.
  2.  Edit on Sense's website, then run
      sense-get
      to download the file back from their site to the MLP.

When you are done, git commit, git push, and grade as usual.
Note that the grader will not be able to give you meaningful feedback
as we do not have a way to authoritatively grade natural language algorithms.
You'll instead get feedback from Sense, and hopefully use it to improve
(or let us know if its bad, and we'll hopefully work on improving the feedback).

Also, in case you are wondering....  We send your code to Sense, but
do not send your identity. We instead send a unique identifier that
looks something like this (you'll see yours in the link you get):

da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709

which Drew can match to your identity, but nobody else can.  Of course,
if you put identifying information in your submission, that will be sent,
but there is no reason for you to do so.
